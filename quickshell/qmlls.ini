#
# IMPORTANT: This path MUST point to the directory containing the compiled
# QML imports (e.g., the directory that holds 'Quickshell/qmldir' if it's
# built via CMake, or the directory containing your 'build' output).
# For a typical simple setup, the project root ('.') might suffice if the 
# Quickshell components are globally available or locally resolved.
#
NoCMakeCalls=true
#
# Optional: List additional directories where custom modules (like Quickshell) 
# are located if they aren't globally installed. Use ';' as a separator.
#
QmlPath=/usr/lib/qt/qml/
# Optional: Specifies the path to the qt-settings.ini file used for 
# resolving resources. Omit this if using a simple setup.
#
# SettingsPath=./qt-settings.ini
